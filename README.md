# Prediction Market  - Aztec JWT Proof

This project uses Noir + Aztec to validate Google email JWTs in the prediction market workflow.
To answer say a climate related question, we want to pick answers from people who have 
expertise in that area, say people with .edu email extension. For the Demo, we will be
using google email addresses.

## Components

- Noir ZK circuit for JWT verification
- Solidity contract to accept proof submissions
